### Pickr Task: React Native Application  ###

#### Given instructions
> *Write a React Native application that consists of a single view, with 3 boxes in it. On startup, in each box, a random single digit number should appear.*
 
> *Below the boxes there should be a button with the text "Generate" in it. When a user clicks the "Generate" button, each box will show a new random digit. The application should make use of a redux store for storing its state.*

> *At the bottom of the view there should be another button, "Show Log". When a user clicks the "Show Log" button, a pop up box should appear, showing a log of all of the generated numbers so far, with 3 numbers in each line. The log of generated numbers should not be saved in the redux store.*

> *Please include build and run instructions for both Android and iOS.*
